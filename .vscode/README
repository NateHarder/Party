To compile and run this program, type:

gcc party.c –o party.out –lpthread

in a terminal, press enter,

Then run it using the format

./party.out s [number of students] –t [number of taxis] –m [max wait time] 

again pressing enter,


[number of students] is the number of students at the party, [number of taxis] is the number of taxis (must be one taxi for every 4 students), and [max wait time] is the maximum times spent at the party.

Limitations: The program requires the formatting of the arguments to follow the above format, and that there must be exactly 4 students for every taxi.
